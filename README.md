# nutriCoachFrontEnd

A nutrition tracking app for the everyday person. Talk about your food in a more intuitive manner than having to manually log like MyFitnessPal. Simply tell NutriCoach what you've had that day , ie. "I had a bowl of cereal this morning", and NutriCoach will automatically find for you the calorie and nutrition info of that food and log it for you. You can also set weekly goal foods - for example, if you tell NutriCoach "at the end of this week, I want to eat cake", NutriCoach will adjust your daily goals accordingly such that you can reward yourself at the end of the week for your hard work.
